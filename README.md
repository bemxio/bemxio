hi i am bem

nowadays i don't really have that much motivation to work on new projects but sometimes i still update repos and once in a while maybe get enough courage to start a new project

check out my pinned repos for projects that i am either proud of or that have got a lot of attention<br/>
also check out [my gists](https://gist.github.com/bemxio) for random scripts and [AUR packages](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages?SeB=M&K=bemxio)

here are some cool cards:
